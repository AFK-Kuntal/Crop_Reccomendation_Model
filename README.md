#**Crop Recommendation Model**

##**Overview**

The Crop Recommendation Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in selecting the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions. By leveraging data-driven insights, this model aims to enhance crop productivity and optimize resource utilization.

##**Features**

Input Parameters: Accepts soil and environmental parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Output: Recommends the most suitable crop for the provided conditions.

Machine Learning Techniques: Uses state-of-the-art algorithms for accurate predictions.

User-Friendly: Can be integrated into web or mobile applications for ease of use.

##**Dataset:**

The model is trained on a dataset containing:

Soil parameters: N, P, K levels.

Environmental conditions: Temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH levels.

Target variable: Recommended crop.

Ensure you have the dataset in the required format before running the model. The dataset used for this model can be found here.

##**Installation**

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Crop-Recommendation-Model.git
cd Crop-Recommendation-Model

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the dataset is in the /data directory.

##**Usage**

Run the notebook for training and evaluation:

jupyter notebook Crop_Recommendation_model.ipynb

(Optional) To predict a crop for new data, use:

python predict.py --input <input_file>

##**Model Training**

The model is built and trained using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and feature encoding.

Feature Selection: Selects the most relevant features for the task.

Model Building: Utilizes algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, or Logistic Regression.

Evaluation: Assesses the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score using test data.

##**Results**

The model achieves the following metrics:

Accuracy: 99.4%
